Welcome to my very first post on my Jekyll blog! ðŸŽ‰

I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and projects with you here. In this blog, I'll talk about:

- My journey as a data scientist and quant.
- Tutorials on machine learning and data science.
- Personal insights and stories from my life.

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
